### Specialized Agent Architecture

The system employs a **simplified three-stage workflow** with clear role separation:

#### **User Interaction Flow**

User ‚Üí Assistant ‚Üî Planner ‚Üí MCP Agent

#### **Assistant Agent (Content Preparation Specialist)**

- **Role**: Content preparation and comprehensive answer specialist
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Thoroughly understand user questions and requests
    - Provide detailed answers or content that fulfills what the user is asking for
    - When users ask for explanations (like "Ë™™Êòé‰∏Ä‰∏ã‰ªÄÈ∫ºÊòØ..."), provide comprehensive explanations
    - Prepare any content, information, or answers needed for execution
    - Focus on WHAT content/information needs to be provided, not just HOW to do it
    - Work in user's language when appropriate
- **Key Principle**: Provides actual content and answers, not just analysis
- **Collaboration**: Works directly with Planner in multi-turn conversations
- **Workflow Position**: First agent in collaborative pair

#### **Planner Agent (Technical Execution Specialist)**

- **Role**: Technical execution planning specialist working with Assistant
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Take the assistant's comprehensive answers and content
    - Incorporate the assistant's content into technical execution plans
    - Map execution steps to available MCP tools
    - Ensure assistant's prepared content is included in the final plan
    - Create step-by-step technical instructions for MCP agent
- **Key Principle**: Assistant provides WHAT content to use, Planner provides HOW to execute it technically
- **Input Information**: Assistant's detailed content plus available tool descriptions
- **Collaboration**: Engages in multi-turn conversation with Assistant
- **Workflow Position**: Second agent in collaborative pair

#### **MCP Agent (Tool Operation Specialist)**

- **Role**: **EXCLUSIVE** external tool operation specialist
- **Expertise**: Direct external tool execution, API operations, system integrations
- **Tools**: **ONLY agent with MCP toolkit registration** - exclusive access to all external tools
- **Input**: Comprehensive execution plan from Assistant-Planner collaboration
- **Capabilities**: Complete independence for all external operations
- **Terminal Role**: Final execution point - terminates after completing tool operations

### Key Methods

- `a_list_tools()`: Lists available MCP tools asynchronously
- `a_run(message)`: Executes three-agent collaborative workflow using `_create_toolkit_and_run()`
- `run(message)`: Synchronous version of `a_run()`
- `_session_context()`: Context manager for MCP session handling
- `_create_toolkit_and_run()`: **MAIN ARCHITECTURE** - Creates collaborative three-agent workflow: Assistant ‚Üî Planner ‚Üí MCP Agent
- `_create_toolkit_and_run_simple()`: Simplified single-agent execution for direct tool usage (legacy/testing)
- `_create_toolkit_and_run_v1()`: Legacy method (currently not used)

- **Centralized Prompts**: All system messages are managed in `src/prompt.py` for consistency and maintainability
- **Specialized Prompt Functions**: Five main functions for generating role-specific prompts:
    - `get_planner_message(tools)`: Creates strategic planning prompts
    - `get_assistant_message(tools)`: Fallback for general tool-aware prompts
- **Universal & Flexible**: Prompts are completely tool-agnostic and work with any MCP server configuration
- **Architecture-Independent**: No hardcoded agent names or specific tool dependencies
- **Clean Format**: Professional, focused prompts without unnecessary decorations
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Automatically adapts to available capabilities and tools

### Dynamic Tool Discovery

The system features **dynamic tool discovery and system message generation**:

- **Real-time Tool Analysis**: Uses `session.list_tools()` to discover available tools at runtime

This ensures that agents always have up-to-date information about available tools and can provide accurate guidance to users, regardless of the specific MCP server configuration.

### Hand-off Strategy

The system implements intelligent agent hand-offs using AutoGen's swarm capabilities with **simplified three-stage workflow**:

#### **Primary Workflow**

User Request ‚Üí Planner ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí (Code Agent OR MCP Agent)

#### **Handoff Conditions**

**Assistant ‚Üî Planner Collaboration**:

- Condition: Multi-turn conversation (up to 6 turns)
- Purpose: Collaborative analysis and planning
- Triggers: Automatic conversation flow between Assistant and Planner

**Planner ‚Üí MCP Agent**:

- Condition: "Plan is complete and ready for execution"
- Triggers: When collaborative planning is finished
- Final execution by MCP Agent with available tools

#### **Secondary Collaboration Flow**

Specialists can collaborate when needed:

**Code Agent Handoffs**:

- "execute this code" ‚Üí Execution Agent
- "need external tools" ‚Üí MCP Agent

**Execution Agent Handoffs**:

- "need external tools" ‚Üí MCP Agent

**MCP Agent**:

- Terminal execution point (no further handoffs)

#### **Simplified Benefits**

### Current Routing Logic

```python
# Sequential workflow: Planner ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí Router ‚Üí (Development Specialist OR Tool Operation Specialist OR Execution Specialist)

# Planner creates plan and hands to manager
register_hand_off(
    agent=planner,
    hand_to=[
        OnCondition(target=manager, condition="Plan is complete and ready for review"),
        AfterWork(agent=AfterWorkOption.TERMINATE),
    ],
)

# Manager reviews plan and routes to router if approved
register_hand_off(
    agent=manager,
    hand_to=[
        OnCondition(target=router_agent, condition="The plan is approved"),
        OnCondition(target=planner, condition="The plan needs revision"),
        AfterWork(agent=AfterWorkOption.TERMINATE),
    ],
)

# Router determines execution path: Development Specialist, Tool Operation Specialist, or Execution Specialist
register_hand_off(
    agent=router_agent,
    hand_to=[
        OnCondition(target=code_agent, condition="This task requires coding"),
        OnCondition(target=mcp_agent, condition="This task requires tools"),
        OnCondition(target=execution_agent, condition="This task requires execution"),
        AfterWork(agent=AfterWorkOption.TERMINATE),
    ],
)
```
