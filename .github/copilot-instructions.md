### Current Routing Logic

```python
# Two-stage collaborative workflow: Assistant ‚Üî Planner ‚Üí MCP Agent

# Step 1: Assistant and Planner collaborate (up to 4 turns)
assistant_plan = await assistant.a_run(
    recipient=planner,
    message=f"""
    Please work together to fulfill this user request:
    User Request: {message}
    Available MCP Tools: {tool_detail}

    Assistant: Please provide comprehensive content/answers that fulfill the user's request.
    Planner: Take the assistant's content and create a detailed technical execution plan.
    """,
    max_turns=4,
)

# Step 2: MCP Agent executes the collaborative plan
result = await mcp_agent.a_run(
    message=f"Original Message:\n{message}\n\nExecution Plan:\n{result_messages}",
    tools=toolkit.tools,
    max_turns=2,
    user_input=False,
)
```

### MCP Server Configurations

The system supports multiple MCP servers with example configurations:

- **Atlassian (mcp-atlassian)**: Jira and Confluence integration

- **Playwright (@playwright/mcp)**: Web automation and testing

## Tool Discovery Process

1. **Session Initialization**: Connect to MCP server (Atlassian, Git, etc.)
2. **Dynamic Discovery**: Call `session.list_tools()` to get available tools
3. **Tool Categorization**: Automatically sort tools by type (Confluence, Jira, etc.)
4. **System Message Generation**: Create context-aware instructions for agents
5. **Agent Configuration**: Set up agents with appropriate tool access and expertise
6. **Task Execution**: Route and execute tasks using the most suitable approach

## Prompt System Architecture

### Direct System Message Integration (`main.py`)

The system now uses **direct system message integration** within the main agent definitions, removing the need for a separate prompt management module:

#### **Assistant Agent System Message**

```python
system_message = """You are an Assistant Agent who provides comprehensive answers and content preparation for user requests.

Your responsibilities:
1. Understand the user's question or request thoroughly
2. Provide detailed answers or content that fulfills what the user is asking for
3. If the user asks for explanations (like "Ë™™Êòé‰∏Ä‰∏ã‰ªÄÈ∫ºÊòØ..."), provide comprehensive explanations
4. Prepare any content, information, or answers that will be needed in the execution
5. Work in the user's language when appropriate
6. Focus on WHAT content/information needs to be provided, not just HOW to do it

You will work with a planner who will use your content and create technical execution plans.
REPLY `TERMINATE` if the request cannot be fulfilled or requires human intervention.
"""
```

#### **Planner Agent System Message**

```python
system_message = """You are a Strategic Planner responsible for creating detailed execution plans.

Your responsibilities:
1. Take the assistant's comprehensive answers and content
2. Incorporate the assistant's content into a technical execution plan
3. Map the execution steps to available MCP tools
4. Ensure the assistant's prepared content is included in the final plan
5. Create step-by-step instructions for the MCP agent

Key principle: The assistant provides WHAT content/information to use,
you provide HOW to execute it technically using the available tools.

You will receive:
- Detailed content and answers from the assistant
- A list of available MCP tools

Create a comprehensive plan that includes both the assistant's content AND
the technical steps for the MCP agent to execute.
REPLY `TERMINATE` if the request cannot be fulfilled or requires human intervention.
"""
```

#### **MCP Agent System Message**

```python
system_message = """
You are an MCP Tool Execution Agent.
You will receive a detailed execution plan from the planner that includes:
- The assistant's prepared content and answers
- A step-by-step technical execution plan using available MCP tools
Follow the execution plan carefully and use the appropriate tools to complete the task.
"""
```

### Design Principles

- **Embedded Integration**: System messages are directly defined within agent creation in `main.py`
- **Role Clarity**: Clear separation of responsibilities between Assistant, Planner, and MCP Agent
- **Collaborative Focus**: Emphasizes collaboration between Assistant and Planner phases
- **Language Flexibility**: Supports multi-language interactions (e.g., Traditional Chinese)
- **Task-Oriented**: Focuses on content preparation vs. technical execution separation
- **Termination Handling**: Built-in TERMINATE conditions for error handling
